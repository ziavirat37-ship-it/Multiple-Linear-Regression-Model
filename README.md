# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model
In this project MLR with assumption is tested
In this project we will work on a data and build a multiple linear regression model. We will also look at the assumption of OLS and at the end will see how many assumption our model has fulfilled. In the first step, we imported the data and all the necessary libraries. Then in the second step, we will inspect the data and collect all the necessary information. We looked at the columns and in the state column we had variables in object type, we changed them to numerical values. As the data is now in correct form, we moved towards the building of the model. In the next step, we assigned x and y values to our independent and dependent variables. The model wsa built then and it was fitted. The results showed that it worked proprly. Next we derived coefficient and intercept values. Furthermore, we interpreted the results of the model. To check the assumption, we conducted various tests. All the results are explained in the workbook.
